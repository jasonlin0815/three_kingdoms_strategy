Permission Service

符合 CLAUDE.md:
- 🔴 Service Layer: Business logic for permission checking
- 🔴 NO direct database calls (use Repository)
- 🟡 Exception chaining with 'from e'
- 🟡 Use native exceptions, not HTTPException

This service is the SINGLE ENTRY POINT for all permission checks:
- Role-based access control (owner, collaborator, member)
- Subscription-based write access control

Usage:
    # For write operations (role + subscription check)
    await permission_service.require_write_permission(user_id, alliance_id, "upload CSV")

    # For owner-only operations (no subscription check needed)
    await permission_service.require_owner(user_id, alliance_id, "delete alliance")
